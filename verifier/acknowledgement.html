              This project could not have been done without the tremendous help from Lawrenceville Alumni Dr. Lawrence Ma’80 and his team. Upon graduating Lawrenceville, Dr. Ma entered Yale University and went on to study mathematics at Stanford University and Cornell University to earn his Masters and PhD in mathematics respectively. Before moving into the industry of blockchain and machine learning, he taught mathematics for several years and worked in qualitative finance. In 2016, Dr. Ma and his business partner Peter Woo founded Emali, an enterprise technology company that develops fintech solutions, specializing in AI, blockchain, cryptography, security, and privacy technologies. Upon learning about my study in his alma mater at Lawrenceville, Dr. Ma offered his company’s latest APIs for me to conduct my own project, a novel digital and trusted graduation diploma system created through cutting-edged cryptography and blockchain technology. Unfortunately before the project was finished, Dr Ma passed away in November 2022. I am grateful for all the guidance he gave me during my journey of blockchain. By completing the project alongside with his business partner, I hope to continue his mission of accelerating advancement and adoption of blockchain technology.

              I would also like to thank my project advisor Mr Bayona and the blockchain club for assisting me with the project.
